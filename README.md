# üîÑ Azure VM Redeploy & Reapply Lab ‚Äì My Experience
In this lab, I explored how to recover a Windows-based Azure virtual machine (VM) that was experiencing connectivity and provisioning issues. I used two key recovery operations available in the Azure portal:

- **Redeploy VM**: When Remote Desktop (RDP) access failed and the VM became unreachable, I used the redeploy option to move the VM to a new physical node within Azure‚Äôs infrastructure. This process retained all configurations, disks, and network settings‚Äîallowing to restore access without losing data.

- **Reapply VM** State: In a separate scenario, the VM entered a failed provisioning state. I resolved this by reapplying the VM‚Äôs state, which triggered a fresh provisioning cycle while preserving the original setup. This helped recover the VM without needing to rebuild it from scratch.

üß™ **What I Practiced** <br> I deployed a Windows Server VM for testing Active Directory and internal applications. When connectivity broke down, I applied these recovery techniques to restore functionality within minutes. This lab strengthened my understanding of Azure‚Äôs troubleshooting tools and taught me how to maintain uptime in both sandbox and production environments.

## üéØ Lab Objectives Achieved: Redeploy & Reapply Azure VM

As part of this lab, I successfully:

- ‚úÖ Identified the difference between **redeploying** and **reapplying** a virtual machine in Azure.
- ‚úÖ Used the Azure portal to **redeploy a Windows-based VM**, resolving Remote Desktop (RDP) connectivity issues without losing configuration or data.
- ‚úÖ Executed the **Reapply VM State** operation to recover a VM stuck in a failed provisioning state.
- ‚úÖ Verified that all VM settings, disks, and networking remained intact after both recovery actions.
- ‚úÖ Demonstrated practical troubleshooting skills for restoring VM health in real-world scenarios.
- ‚úÖ Strengthened my confidence in maintaining uptime and reliability across Azure infrastructure.

This lab reinforced my ability to handle VM recovery operations with precision and clarity ‚Äî a key skill for any cloud engineer working in production or sandbox environments.
